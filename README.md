# Global_Temperature_Anomaly_Forecast

Accurate forecasting of global land surface temperature anomalies is essential for climate resilience, policy formulation, and long-term environmental planning. This study introduces a hybrid modeling framework that integrates statistical and machine learning approaches to enhance predictive performance and interpretability. We use NOAA’s monthly global temperature anomaly dataset from January 1951 to October 2024, enriched with 16 oceanic and atmospheric indices, including NINO3.4, PDO, QBO, AO, WHWP, and TSA. Over 80 derived features—such as lags, rolling statistics, difference variables, and anomaly flags—were constructed. Through rigorous feature filtering using correlation analysis, VIF diagnostics, and non-parametric tests (e.g., Mann–Whitney U and ANOVA), a final subset of 42 statistically meaningful predictors was selected. Time series models including ARIMA and SARIMA were optimized via grid search using ACF/PACF diagnostics and seasonal differencing (s = 12, D = 1). The best-performing classical model was SARIMA(2,1,2)(1,1,1,12) with an RMSE of 0.2725 and R² of 0.8157. Residuals from the ARIMA(2,1,2) model were further modeled using various machine learning algorithms. Gradient Boosting emerged as the most effective, forming the basis of a hybrid model. The ARIMA + Gradient Boosting hybrid achieved the highest predictive accuracy (MAE: 0.2118, RMSE: 0.2690, R²: 0.8475). Paired t-tests confirmed that its improvements over ARIMA was statistically significant (p < 0.05). SHAP analysis further revealed the dominant influence of short-term fluctuations in WHWP, TSA, and NINO3.4 on temperature anomalies. The hybrid model was used to forecast anomalies for the period November 2024 to March 2025, demonstrating high alignment with known climatic patterns. Overall, this study presents a statistically robust, explainable, and high-performing framework for global temperature anomaly forecasting—offering a reproducible blueprint for future climate modeling efforts.
